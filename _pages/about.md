Welcome to Xiao Song's homepage. I obtained my Bachelor's degree in CS from the University of Michigan Ann Arbor, with a minor in Statistics, and obtained my Master's degree in EECS from the University of California Berkeley. I'm broadly interested in C++, Parallel Computing, and High Performence Computation. 


For anyone who visits my homepage, please also take time to consider donating to [China Social Welfare Foundation's Rural Area Girl Education Program](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z09.2.0.0.7e272e8d0WkMM7&id=574417828870&_u=3qt913s669f) your generosity will help girls in rural China get a decent education.
